# FOREACH imitations

- this should be one-liner:
- `not none? find/same/skip queue reduce [reactor :reaction] 4`
- but if we imagine q/3 rather than q/2:
- `foreach [:reactor _ :reaction _] [return yes] no`
- `forparse [reactor skip reaction skip] [return yes] no`
- `foreach [x _ y _ /where all [x = reactor y = :reaction]] [return yes] no`
- `not empty? filter queue [x _ y _] [all [x = reactor y = :reaction]]`
- `not empty? sift queue [1 - - - .. 1 = (reactor) and 3 = (reaction)]`
- `locate queue [[is (reactor)] - [is (reaction)] -]`
```
    pending?: function [reactor [object!] reaction [block! function!]][
        q: queue
        while [q: find/same/skip q reactor 4][
            if same? :q/2 :reaction [return yes]
            q: skip q 4
        ]
        no
    ]
```

- searches rows by reactor
- filtered foreach:
- `foreach/same [:reactor word reaction targets] relations [...]`
- `foreach [r word reaction targets /where r =? reactor] relations [...]`
- `foreach [_ word reaction targets] filter relations [r _ _ _] [r =? reactor] [...]`
- `foreach [word reaction targets] sift relations [- 2 3 4 .. 1 =? reactor] [...]`
```
    pos: relations
    while [pos: find/same/skip pos reactor 4][

```

- this should be a `find/same` one-liner, but it's bugged (#4165)
- there's a bug in `reactor = context?` (#4166)
- workarounds:
- `foreach [pos: _ _ reaction :field] [if reactor =? context? :pos/4 [return reaction]]`
- `field: in reactor field  foreach/same [_ _ reaction :field] [return reaction]`
- `field: in reactor field  foreach [_ _ reaction f /where f =? field] [return reaction]`
- `first sift relations [- - 3 - .. 4 =? (in reactor field)]`
- `third locate relations [- - - [same (in reactor field)]]`
```
    pos: skip relations 3
    while [pos: find/skip pos field 4][
        if reactor = context? pos/1 [return pos/-1]
        pos: skip pos 4

```

- same; workarounds:
- `foreach/same [:reactor :field reaction _] [return :reaction]`
- ...
- `first sift relations [- - 3 - .. 1 =? (reactor) and 2 = (field)]`
- `third locate [[is (reactor)] [is (field)] - -]`

- from `check-cfg` of GUI console:
- iter is a block `[set-word: value ...]`
- joins options from config and default config
- it's interesting because it replaces invalid lines, and adds those not found
- a single remove-each won't handle it
- `foreach [word val] [...]` - the best way?
```
    while [not tail? iter][
        either f: find cfg iter/1 [
            if (type? f/2) <> type? iter/2 [

- from GUI console `red-complete-path` (internal)

- foreach with index
- 2 rules are generated in parallel
- `[xxxxx xxxxx ..] -> [xxxxx (m: index?) | ..] and [xxx (m: index?) | ..]`
- `map-each m list [p: ... compose [xxxxx (p) | ]]`
- `map-each m list [p: ... compose [xxx (p) | ]]`
- can we make it simple in one go? should we?
- using morph DSL: `morph [:list m (i: index? list) month: m i pipe (m': copy/part m 3) mon: m' i pipe]` - roughly the whole loop
```
    list: system/locale/months
    while [not tail? list][
