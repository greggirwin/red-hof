# FORALL

FORALL is a somewhat low-level construct. It's main use is to **provide for the deficiencies of FOREACH**:
- 42% were imitating MAP-EACH, latter being unavailable or limited (67% in-place maps, 33% mapped into another target)
- 31% were meant to be FOREACHs, but didn't become so for whatever reason
- 20% were adding an index to FOREACH, noble cause if REPEAT wouldn't have been better at that
- 1 case was a REPEAT in disguise
- 1 case was imitating a REMOVE-EACH
- 4% (only) were really meant to be FORALLs

Among FOREACH imitations, **18%** were **lookups** (break or return after a value is found).
About **11%** of all FORALLs were **filtering** the inputs before processing.

**Features** of FORALL:
- It **provides an index** in the form of series position, although in the vast majority of cases that index is **used numerically** as `index? series`. This is easy to add into FOREACH.
- With that index one can **modify the series** in place. Something a MAP-EACH must be able to do more gracefully.
- Easy access to **adjacent items** - `series/2`, `series/3`... Can be done with a refinement for FOREACH (e.g. `/stride`) that will fix it's step at 1 and also prevent iterations where one of the need items is over the tail (FORALL requires an additional check for that).
- It's **possible to advance** the series when needed, when the loop algorithm requires. This can be solved by adding an `advance` function to FOREACH, same as we have `keep` in COLLECT.
- It's **possible to replace** the series: `forall s [.. s: something-else..]`, and FORALL continues on the new series. Well, it's possible in R2 & R3, but not in Red â˜» Red complains about that, by design.

I believe we can almost totally replace FORALL (along with half of WHILEs and UNTILs) with **more declarative `-each`** loops if we provide the facilities mentioned above.

One other feature is that FORALL **leaves the index** of the series as is **after a BREAK**.
Sometimes this was used in lookups: index after BREAK tells *where* the found item is.
In one identified case this feature was used to update the series index to later be able to enter another FORALL, from that index.
**Most of the time** though, it was either **assumed** that the loop finishes without BREAK, so the index will be set to head, or this feature was **fought against** by placing an explicit `series: head series` after. And it makes sense - very **rarely** we want the series be **left not at it's head**.

## Imitations of MAP-EACH, in-place, unfiltered

Most of these can be considered "bulk application" (see [FOREACH](foreach/README.md))

---
- in-place map + accumulator
- `map-each p shape [pos: pos + p]`
```
	forall shape [shape/1: pos: pos + shape/1]
```

---
- `map-each xy dxy [sqrt xy]`, but better to support `sqrt` on vectors
```
	forall dxy [dxy/1: sqrt dxy/1]
```

---
- in-place map with skip=2; `val` and `char` are strings; should deadlock if `1 < length? char` ?
- `map-each x val [rejoin [char x]]` - way cleaner
- `map-each/sep x val [x] char`
- `delimit val char`
```
	forall val [
		insert val char
		val: next val
	]
```

---
- in-place map with skip=2
- `parse body [any [skip change set x skip (form x)]]`
- `map-each [x y] body [reduce [x form y]]`
- `map-each/eval [x y] body [ [x form y] ]`
- `map-each x body [advance form x]`
```
	forall body [body: next body body/1: form body/1]
```

- normal map over 2 vectors
- `map-each [x y] zip [v1 v2] [f x y]` - just as slow :)
```
vjoin: func [v1 v2 f] [

	]
```


## Imitations of FOREACH with index

Curiously, almost all these examples use `forall series [..index? series..]` to achieve their goal.
Where REPEAT seems more suitable for that: `repeat i length? series [..i..]`.

---
- maximum with an index of it; though `find` may be faster if we make an R/S maximum func

## Imitations of FOREACH without index

Why not use foreach? Could be mistakes? Refactoring leftovers?

- true forall - saves index of `lines'`; can be indexed foreach but that probably won't win a thing
```
	forall lines' [
		pos: (cells-to-size cells) - ori
		if sz/y <= pos/y [break]
		ln: lines'/1
		if all [text?  subs: leave-only ln sub][
			keep compose [pen (cbox) text (pos + hlofs) (make-boxes subs) pen (ctxt)]

		keep compose [text (pos) (ln)]
		if all [text?  subs][

		if com: find ln #";" [
			exc: make-excerpt ln com length? ln

- this should be `repeat n length? block [repend ...]`
```
	forall block [
		append spec compose/deep/only [(to-word join '_ n) [decimal!]]
		n: n + 1
